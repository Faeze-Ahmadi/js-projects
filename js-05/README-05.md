## js-05 (Random Parameres)

This folder is designed for the fifth JavaScript exercise for random parameters.

In the beginning, there is an empty list, which, in the continuation of the code of a function, has an object inside it, which can create a random number, date, and word.
The task of the function is to add three random parameters in the form of object to the initial list.

I took help from GBT chat and Google to get random number, date and word
