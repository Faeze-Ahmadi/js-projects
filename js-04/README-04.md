## js-04 (temperature conversion, word search or product information)

This file is for the fourth JavaScript exercise, which is divided into three parts.

At first, you will be asked a question about whether you want to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit or search for a word in a sentence or add and remove product information.
Choose any of these three sections, you will enter the function of that section.

In the first part, you will enter a function where you give the degree of the number and that number will be converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

In the second part, you will be asked for a sentence and a word. The task of the function is to search for the word in the sentence. If there is, you will be shown "Exists".

In the last part, there is product information in the form of objects. The user will be asked if he is she wants to add the product to the cart or not. There are two functions to add and remove the product and its information. Also, the shopping cart list is empty at first.

To do this project, I used GBT chat to get some information.
