## js-07 (TypeScript)
## Previous JavaScript project using typescript

Like the previous projects, this project consists of three parts. The difference between this folder and the previous parts is the use of typescript programming language.

First, I installed node.js on the system to access npm package management.
Then, I started this package using "npm init" and stored its information under the title of project ID.
In the next step, with the command "npm i -g typescript", I installed the typescript language globally in the system.
Creating a .ts file is necessary to start working.
Of course, the browser does not have the ability to read the typescript language, so we must create a Javascript file with the "tsc --init" command so that we can link it to the html file.
The next steps are just like the previous projects and I implemented the same Javascript code
Of course, it goes without saying that defining the type of variables in typescript language is mandatory and you cannot leave any variable without an identity.
The commands I used in the terminal in this project include the following:
npm init
npm i -g typescript
tsc --init
In general, I used the following commands and methods to complete the project:
Variables
Functions
Conditional functions
Arrays
Objects
command prompt to get input
push command
sort command and localeCompare
slice command
break command

I took help from JBT Chat for this exercise.
