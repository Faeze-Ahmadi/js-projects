## js-07 (use tailwind and flowbite)
## html, css, js, ts with use tailwind and flowbite
## The eighth exercise of JavaScript

I took the help of JavaScript and Typescript code to ask two questions from the user in the form of a question box.
I wrote the css and html code using tailwind and flowbite tools.
In this project, I was actually learning skills related to using npm tools and extension related to vscode.

I took help from JBT Chat for this exercise.
